# masq_server
Custom server project for the shockwave game masq.

MASQ is a 2002 adult visual novel that has an online only drm that was shut down.

My goal is to have some part of the game playable again, from some reverseengineering I think 2 Episodes should be playable.

With the help of reddit user gamstat we managed to get in game but only part of the game is playable if you choose to not register.
